## Are you hiring?
I'm looking for work, and ideally I'd love to work as a data analyst or some related role. I have some basic website skills as well. In the long run, if the job involves conservation or even green tech, that would be a dream. I did about 90% of the Udemy Web Development Bootcamp at the start of the year.

Through my years in the tourism industry I've learned leadership and simple hard work. I've managed small teams and worked with high-end clientele.
